2. Go to the Cirrus website, log in, and navigate to an existing form or collection. The recommended approach is to go into a form, as it ensures that the overview or assessment matrix is generated with the latest information once the test is finalized.

3. Click on the Cirrus Maximus icon in your toolbar. Via the options you can set the language of the interface to Dutch and change the csv delimiter. The two buttons allow you to export the form or collection overview or export the assessment matrix.
