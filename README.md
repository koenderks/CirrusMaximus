2. Go to the Cirrus website and navigate into an existing form or collection. Best practice is to go into a form, since such a finalized test usually requires an assessment matrix.

3. Click on the Cirrus Maximus icon in your toolbar. Via the options you can set the language of the interface to Dutch and change the csv delimiter. The other two options allow you to export the assessment data or export the assessment matrix.
